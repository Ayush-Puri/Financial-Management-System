## Authentication

Authentication

All non-public API endpoints require authentication using JWT (JSON Web Token).

Authentication Process
- Users must first log in using their credentials at /public/login.
- Upon successful login, the API responds with a JWT token in the response body.
- For all authenticated requests, this token must be included in the Authorization header as a Bearer Token.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Using Bearer Token in Postman
When testing APIs in Postman, do not use the "JWT Bearer" option.

‚úÖ Use the "Bearer Token" option under Authorization

1. Go to Authorization in Postman.
2. Select "Bearer Token" from the dropdown.
3. Copy the token from the login response.
4. Paste it into the Token field.

üìå Do not use the "JWT Bearer" option, as it will not work with this API.
